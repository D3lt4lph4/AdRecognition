\section{Introduction}

This Machile Learning assignment aim to look into different machile learning techniques in order to identify advertissment and legitimate contents. The final use of this kind of classifier could be for instance for programs such as adblock which allow the blocking of advertissement within web pages.

This report will detail the process used to create models in order to differanciate between adverts and non adverts content within internet web pages. The three models used are svm, random Forest and Neural network.
In order to be able to compare the differents methods over the testing phase the dataset will be devided in two.

The code which will be given is the final code with all the methods mixed together (if discerning), also it is possible to have access to the previous version of the code which are tagged on a git repository. All the models will be saved so it is possible to calculate each of the outputs obtained after each step of the process. Finaly, the whole project will require/provide the following :
\begin{itemize}
  \item CMake 2.6;
  \item Opencv 2.4.13;
  \item Working executables for each classifier;
  \item A working executable to test the models.
\end{itemize}
