\section{Introduction}

This Machine Learning assignment aim to take a look at different machine learning techniques in order to identify advertissment and legitimate contents on web pages. The final use of this kind of classifier could be for instance for programs such as adblock which allow the blocking of advertissement within web pages.

This report will detail the process used to create models in order to differanciate between adverts and non adverts contents within internet web pages.

The three models used are svm, random Forest and Neural network :
\begin{itemize}
  \item svm :
  \item Random Forest :
  \item Neural Network :
\end{itemize}
\vspace{\baselineskip}

Each model will be tested following a series of testing methods in order to find the best model possible.
The testing method will be carring out in the following order :
\begin{itemize}
  \item First approach, simple test of the methods;
  \item Parameter optimization, opimization of one of the parameter used;
  \item Priors \& Noramlization, test of the models taking into account data repartion and normalizing the data;
  \item Cross validation, use of the kfold method to find the best parameter.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{\baselineskip}

The code which will be given is the final code with all the methods mixed together, nevertheless it is possible to have access to the previous version of the code which are branched on a git repository. All the models will be saved so it is possible to calculate each of the outputs obtained after each step of the process. Finaly, the whole project will require/provide the following :
\begin{itemize}
  \item CMake 2.6 (r);
  \item Opencv 2.4.13 (r);
  \item Working executables for each classifier (p);
  \item A working executable to test the models (p).
\end{itemize}
