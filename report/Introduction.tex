\chapter{Introduction}

This report will detail the process used to create models in order to differanciate between ads and non ads with internet web pages. The three models used are svm, random Forest and Neural network.
In order to be able to compare the differents methods over the testing phase the dataset will be devided in the following way, the original data is pre-cut into two subset one of 353 samples for testing across all the models and the other of 2006 samples for training all of the models. The class are spread over both of the subset to keep the initial ratio of the first dataset (0.161509).
